Data Collection

Imported the Black Friday dataset (CSV format).

Loaded the data into Python using Pandas.

Data Exploration (EDA)

Checked dataset shape, data types, and missing values.

Used .info() and .describe() for summary statistics.

Visualized distributions of features (Age, Gender, Occupation, Product Categories, Purchase Amount).

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (imputation or removal).

Removed duplicates if any.

Standardized categorical values for consistency.

Feature Engineering

Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).

Created new features if relevant (e.g., total purchases per user).

Normalized or scaled numerical features where needed.

Exploratory Insights

Analyzed purchasing patterns across Gender, Age Groups, Occupation, and City.

Identified top-selling product categories.

Compared spending behavior across demographics.

Visualization

Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to create bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

Highlighted trends such as which age group spends the most or which city has higher sales.

Model Building (Optional if included)

Built a predictive model (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost) to estimate purchase amounts.

Evaluated using RMSE, RÂ², or accuracy depending on the task.

Conclusion

Summarized key findings (e.g., "Men in the 26â€“35 age group purchased the most", "Product Category 1 had the highest sales").

Suggested business strategies based on insights.
